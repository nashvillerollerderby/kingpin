This directory is for custom screens such as different broadcast overlays,
penalty views, scoreboards etc. to be placed in.

It maps to the html/custom directory in your CRG install.

It is recommended that each set of screens gets its own subdirectory under
custom, to allow multiple to co-exist. All assets such as images and javascript
should also be kept under here.
